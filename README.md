# E-Commerce Management System

## Overview

The E-Commerce Management System is a web application designed to manage customer information, product inventories, and orders. This application is built using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, simulating an in-memory database. It provides essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for customers, products, and orders, allowing users to efficiently manage an e-commerce system.

## Features

### Customer Management
- **Add New Customer:** Allows the addition of new customers with details such as name, email, and phone number.
- **View Customer Details:** Retrieve details of a specific customer by entering their ID.
- **Update Customer Details:** Update the details of an existing customer using their ID.
- **Delete Customer:** Remove a customer from the system using their ID.

### Product Management
- **Add New Product:** Allows the addition of new products with details such as product name and price.
- **View Product Details:** Retrieve details of a specific product by entering its ID.
- **Update Product Details:** Update the details of an existing product using its ID.
- **Delete Product:** Remove a product from the system using its ID.

### Order Management
- **Place a New Order:** Create a new order by selecting a customer and one or more products, and specifying the order date.
- **View Order Details:** Retrieve details of a specific order by entering its ID, including the customer's name, product names, and the order date.
- **Update Order Details:** Update the details of an existing order, including the customer ID, products, and order date.
- **Cancel Order:** Remove an order from the system using its ID.

## Application Architecture

### Frontend
The frontend is built using React and provides an intuitive user interface for managing customers, products, and orders. Each section is divided into functional components:
- **Customer Components:** Handle customer-related functionalities such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting customers.
- **Product Components:** Manage product-related operations including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting products.
- **Order Components:** Facilitate order-related tasks such as placing, viewing, updating, and canceling orders.

### Backend
The backend is built using Express.js and handles the API requests made by the frontend. It uses an in-memory "database" to store customers, products, and orders during runtime.

- **Customer Routes:**
  - `POST /api/customers` - Create a new customer.
  - `GET /api/customers` - Retrieve all customers.
  - `GET /api/customers/:id` - Retrieve a single customer by ID.
  - `PUT /api/customers/:id` - Update a customer by ID.
  - `DELETE /api/customers/:id` - Delete a customer by ID.

- **Product Routes:**
  - `POST /api/products` - Create a new product.
  - `GET /api/products` - Retrieve all products.
  - `GET /api/products/:id` - Retrieve a single product by ID.
  - `PUT /api/products/:id` - Update a product by ID.
  - `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Delete a product by ID.

- **Order Routes:**
  - `POST /api/orders` - Place a new order.
  - `GET /api/orders/:id` - Retrieve a single order by ID.
  - `PUT /api/orders/:id` - Update an order by ID.
  - `DELETE /api/orders/:id` - Cancel an order by ID.

### In-Memory "Database"
The backend uses in-memory arrays to simulate database tables:
- **customers:** Stores customer objects.
- **products:** Stores product objects.
- **orders:** Stores order objects, which include references to customers and products.

### Error Handling
Each route has error handling to manage situations where data is missing or IDs are not found. For example, if a customer ID is not found during a retrieval request, the server will return a 404 status code with an appropriate error message.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ecommerce-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will start both the frontend (React) and the backend (Express.js) concurrently.

4. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Managing Customers:**
   - Use the customer management section to add, view, update, or delete customers.
   
2. **Managing Products:**
   - Use the product management section to add, view, update, or delete products.
   
3. **Managing Orders:**
   - Use the order management section to place, view, update, or cancel orders.

## Future Improvements

- **Persistent Storage:** Implement a real database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) for storing customer, product, and order data persistently.
- **User Authentication:** Add user authentication and authorization to control access to the management functionalities.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Improve the UI/UX design to provide a more polished and user-friendly interface.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
